mpv for Debian
==============

This is the Debian package produced by the mpv-build scripts. It
contains a statically linked libass and ffmpeg (vs. libav contained in
Debian) from upstream. It is not an official part of the Debian
distribution. Instructions for building this package can be found in
the README.rst file in the mpv-build directory, or equivalently at [1].

Differences with the official Debian package
============================================

Debian testing/unstable already has a separate official package for
mpv, which closely tracks the current upstream releases. The biggest
difference between this package and the one in the official Debian
archive is that it statically links against the latest upstream
version of ffmpeg and libass. Debian uses the libav fork of ffmpeg,
and therefore that's what the official package links against. However,
as described at [2], ffmpeg is preferred for building mpv. The version
of libass in Debian unstable also has a slight lag behind the current
upstream release used to build this package.

Furthermore, the official Debian mpv package is ONLY available in
unstable/testing. It will in general not work in Debian stable (there
is currently no version in backports) or in any current release of
Ubuntu. This package on the other hand, builds and installs on both Debian
stable, and testing/unstable as well as Ubuntu precise (12.04) and saucy
(13.10). For the older distributions, this package is probably the best
alternative.

In order to maintain this interoperability between distributions, this
package must necessarily disable some features by default which are
not universally supported. This includes decoding with libmpg123 (as
opposed to the decoders built into ffmpeg), sdl2 audio output, and
Wayland video support (which may nevertheless still be enabled
manually provided sufficiently recent libraries - see below). On the
other hand, this package enables video4Linux and native samba support
(to play smb:// URLs), which are not present in the official Debian
package.

There are several other features that are disabled in both this
package as well as the official Debian package because they are not
widely needed or used. These include caca, radio interface, openal
output, portaudio output, rsound/libroar/sndio input/output, sdl1,
joystick, videoio.h/libpt. If you find any of these useful, please
open an issue at [3] explaining why you think the feature in question
should be enabled, and we can try and include it in this package.

Finally, in addition to the default of building the latest released
version of mpv, this package can also trivially be built from the
latest git master of mpv (as well as ffmpeg and libass). As described
in README.rst [1], this is achieved by calling

    ./update --master 

prior to building this Debian package.

Non-free encoding codecs
========================

The optional encoding libraries libx264 and libmp3lame are already
enabled by this package. To enable additional non-free codecs,
manually install Fraunhofer FDK AAC codec development files 

    apt-get install libfdk-aac-dev

and add the relevant options to the mpv-build/ffmpeg_options file

    echo --enable-nonfree    >> ffmpeg_options
    echo --enable-libfdk-aac >> ffmpeg_options

This must be done prior to building this package.

Wayland support
===============

According to wayland.freedesktop.org, "Wayland is intended as a
simpler replacement for X, easier to develop and maintain". It is very
much a work in progress, so adequate functionality requires recent
version of the relevant libraries. At present, this is only possible
on Debian testing/unstable (not stable or Ubuntu precise or saucy). To
maintain interoperability, this package therefore does not build with
Wayland support by default.

If you want Wayland support, you will need to manually install the
necessary packages before building:

    apt-get install libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev

The mpv build will then automatically detect and link to them.

Note that for mpv=0.3.4, you need 

    libwayland-dev>=1.2.0, libxkbcommon-dev>=0.3.0,

while for mpv in git master, you need

    libwayland-dev>=1.3.0, libxkbcommon-dev>=0.3.0
